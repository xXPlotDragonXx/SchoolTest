The class Princesses were Aliyah Goldsmith (Senior), Jordan Hamon (Junior), McKenna Gibson (Sophomore), and Madison Willis (Freshman). Senior football players were also recognized.</p>
<p>Pickens won the toss and chose to receive. They moved the ball down the field but the Devildog defense stopped them in the red zone and Pickens had to settle for a field goal to take a 3-0 lead with 5:27 left in the first quarter. The Devildogs responded on their first series and took the lead with a pass from Hendricks to Fields with 1:48 left in the first quarter. Right before the touchdown the Devildogs kept the series alive with a conversion on 4th and 1. The score remained 10-7 after one quarter of play.</p>
<p>Pickens again moved the ball well in the second quarter and scored on a four yard run with 10:42 left in the first half. The point after gave them a 10-7 lead. Turnovers stopped both teams following that score. The Devildogs fumbled on their first play of their next series and Pickens recovered. Pickens turned the ball over with a fumble and the Devildogs took over with four minutes left in the half. They moved the ball down the field but an incomplete pass on fourth down near the goal line ended the drive. The Devildog defense recovered another fumble with 2:46 left in the first half but were unable to score. The Blue Flame led 10-7 at the half.</p>
<p>The Devildog offense put together a great drive to open the second half that resulted in a 14 yard TD run by Cam Henderson. The PAT gave them a 14-10 lead. Pickens was forced to punt but a fumble on the return gave them back the ball near midfield. The score remained 14-10 going into the final quarter.</p>
<p>Hendricks hit Fields for a second TD pass play, this one covering 50 yards, and the Devildogs led 21-10. Brooks Russ-Martin intercepted one of Pickens' rare pass attempts to stop their next drive. Pickens had their own interception of a tipped ball to end a Devildog drive. The Devildog defense topped Pickens on a pair of drives late in the game and Hendricks took a knee on the final two plays as the Devildogs moved to 4-0 on the season for the second year in a row. They will travel to Blue Ridge for a non-region contest next week and have the following week off before starting region play at Greer.</p>
